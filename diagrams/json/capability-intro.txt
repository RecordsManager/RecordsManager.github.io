As part of the Digital Transformation agenda here at USW, Nath is creating a Digital Roadmap for IT at USW to deliver the IT products that we need going forward.

There are key principles 

Aligned to Academic Plan and corporate priorities​
Embrace innovation​
Customer Centric​
Digital Literacy is key​
Data Driven​
Agility​
Usable ​
Secure​

That will be drivers for the creation of the Roadmap. We are currently in a discovery phase of the Roadmap where we are seeking to understand stakeholders' current and future needs. We are using a capability model to facilitate this understanding - we would like people to focus on and what they are trying to achieve and how IT can help.

The Capability​ Model approach seeks to group activities that you need to according to business capabilities and then look at what processes current use IT. This approach helps everyone to understand how the organisation can fulfill it's varied functions and identify areas where IT can be used most effectively. To achieve this we need to first understand current IT landscape. 

This is where we need colleagues help. We would like to invite you to be involved in workshops where we gather information about the many things you need to do and you will be able to feedback on how IT might be able to help.


Do i need something about the strategic plan/plans?
Do I want to include the USW Capability​ Diagram?
